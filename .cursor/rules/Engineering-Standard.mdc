Always propose a short plan before editing.
Prefer minimal diffs; do not rewrite whole files unless requested.
Any DB change must include:
migration file
rollback note
updated schema notes
After adding or modifying migrations, always run: php backend/migrations/run.php (or c:\xampp\php\php.exe backend/migrations/run.php on Windows)
Any endpoint change must include:
request/response examples
validation
authorization check
tests (at least smoke)
Never commit secrets; use env vars.
Add structured logs for important workflows.
